# simpleChatbox-ESA-serverless
This repository is a refactor of my first AI chatbox, which I originally completed on Dec 17, 2025, after just 1.5 months of learning web development.  I am currently upgrading the original vanilla HTML/CSS/JS code to include a simple serverless backend. The goal is to deploy it on Alibaba Cloud ESA to securely manage API keys.
